### Experiment: Running a Quantized BGE-M3 Embedding Model in the Browser for Full Privacy

This experiment aims to demonstrate running a quantized BGE-M3 embedding model directly in the browser, supporting multilingual and cross-lingual similarities while ensuring full privacy. The model runs entirely on the client side, avoiding any data transmission to external servers.
